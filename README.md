**Plot boundary gradient vector**

The code here needs to be used in conjunction with the relevant methods in paper *Unified PID Control Analysis for Time-Delay Plants*. 

All of these coed is written in MATLAB. Among them, the code in program **Arg** is used to calculate the phase angle related to time delay, and continuity has already been taken into account. The Delta in program **plotGradientVector** and **plot_curves** can be directly obtained using the relevant methods in *Unified PID Control Analysis for Time-Delay Plants*. If necessary, it can also be obtained through program **computeDelta**, but it must be ensured that Delta has the same quantity as the gradient vector to guarantee numerical matching. Note that the function handles in **plot_curves** and **plotGradientVector** are the parametric equations of the relevant parametric curves or surfaces, while in **computeDelta**, *Fr* and *Fi* represent the real and imaginary parts of the characteristic equation when *s = iÏ‰*.

**Note**: The relevant code for singular lines or planes is not provided above because such lines or planes are essentially parallel to a certain coordinate axis or plane. Therefore, their plotting does not present any significant difficulty. As for their gradient vectors, they can be directly calculated using the gradient vector computation method in *Unified PID Control Analysis for Time-Delay Plants*, and no issues are expected to arise.
